"Notes: The estimates are developed from a base that incorporates the 2020 Census, Vintage 2020 estimates, and 2020 Demographic Analysis estimates. Median age is calculated based on single year of age. For population estimates methodology statements, see https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/technical-documentation/methodology.html. The estimates feature geographic boundaries from the Vintage 2020 estimates series; the geographic boundaries for these 2021 population estimates are as of January 1, 2020.  ",,,,,,,,,
