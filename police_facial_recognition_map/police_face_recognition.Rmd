## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}

# For summaries of only police agencies using facial recognition

all_face_recognition <- read_csv("face_recognition.csv")

police_sheriff_face_recognition <- all_face_recognition %>%
  filter(`Type of LEA` == "Police" | `Type of LEA` == "Sheriff" | `Type of LEA` == "State Police") %>%
  select(City, State, `Type of LEA`, Agency, Vendor) 

police_sheriff_face_recognition <- paste(police_sheriff_face_recognition$City, police_sheriff_face_recognition$State)


write_csv(police_sheriff_face_recognition,"police_sheriff_face_recognition.csv")

# For cloropleth summaries of each state

facial_recognition_summaries <- police_sheriff_face_recognition %>%
  group_by(State) %>%
  summarise(count = n()) 

write_csv(facial_recognition_summaries,"summaries_facial_recognition.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
